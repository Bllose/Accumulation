# Bokeh  
### Bokeh at a Glance
#### Flexible
Bokeh makes it simple to create common plots, but also can handle custom or specialized use-cases.  
#### Interactive
Tools and widgets let you and your audience probe "what if" scenarios or drill-down into the details of your data.
#### Shareable
Plots, dashboards, and apps can be published in web pages or Jupyter notebooks.
#### Productive
Work in Python close to all the PyData tools you are already familiar with.  
#### Powerful
You can always add custom JavaScript to support advanced or specialized cases.
#### Open Source
Everything, including the Bokeh server, is BSD licensed and available on GitHub.
