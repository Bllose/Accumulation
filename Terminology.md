# Cross-cutting concern & AOP  
Aspect-oriented programming aims to encapsulate cross-cutting concerns into aspects to retain modularity. 
This allows for the clean isolation and reuse of code addressing the cross-cutting concern. 
By basing designs on cross-cutting concerns, software engineering benefits can include modularity and simplified maintenance.
