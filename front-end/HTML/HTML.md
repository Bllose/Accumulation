#### Concept and syntax  
An HTML document is a plaintext document structured with elements. Elements are surrounded by matching opening and closing tags. Each tag begins and ends with angle brackets (```<>```). 
There are a few empty or void tags that cannot enclose any text, for instance ```<img>```.  
You can extend HTML tags with attributes, which provide additional information affecting how the browser interprets the element:  
![element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTML/anatomy-of-an-html-element.png)  
An HTML file is normally saved with an ```.htm``` or ```.html``` extension, served by a web server, and can be rendered by any Web browser.
